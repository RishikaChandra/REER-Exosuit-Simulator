# REER MATLAB Simulator

A **MATLAB-based simulation tool** to analyze **joint load and fatigue reduction** for an emergency exosuit (REER).  
This project explores how adjustable assist levels and lift durations affect joint torque and fatigue during emergency rescue operations.

## Features

- Interactive **MATLAB App Designer UI**  
- Simulates **joint torque** and **fatigue index** over time  
- Adjustable parameters:
  - Lift duration
  - Assistance level
- Generates plots to visualize **fatigue reduction**  
- Supports experimentations for design optimization of exosuits
