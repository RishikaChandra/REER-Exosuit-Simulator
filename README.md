# REER Load & Fatigue Analysis

**Objective:** Compare joint torque and fatigue for human-only vs exosuit-assisted lifting.

**Features:**
- Computes torque for single joint
- Models fatigue index (torque × lift time)
- Visualizes comparison for one lift or multiple load weights

**MATLAB Skills Used:**
- Functions
- Loops & vectors
- Data visualization (bar & line plots)
- Simple engineering modeling

**Impact:** Demonstrates how exosuit assistance reduces joint stress and fatigue in emergency lifting scenarios.
