# REER MATLAB Simulator

A **MATLAB-based simulation tool** to analyze **joint load and fatigue reduction** for an emergency exosuit (REER).  
This project explores how adjustable assist levels and lift durations affect joint torque and fatigue during emergency rescue operations.

---

## Features

- Interactive **MATLAB App Designer UI**  
- Simulates **joint torque** and **fatigue index** over time  
- Adjustable parameters:
  - Lift duration
  - Assistance level
- Generates plots to visualize **fatigue reduction**  
- Supports experimentations for design optimization of exosuits

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- MATLAB R2022a or later  
- MATLAB App Designer (for `.mlapp` file)  

### How to Run
1. Open `REER_GUI.mlapp` in MATLAB App Designer  
2. Click **Run**  
3. Adjust sliders for lift duration and assist level  
4. Observe torque and fatigue plots in real-time

- Learned MATLAB basics: scripting, plotting, App Designer  
- Built a tool to **simulate human-robot interaction** in emergency rescue  
- Next: integrate more joints, automate batch simulations, and explore **MATLAB Web App** deployment
